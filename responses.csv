Photography plays with colour, focus, shadow and light. The word 'photograph' has Greek origins that translate to 'drawing light.' To wander and document what is around us, we may 'draw light,' not only into our cameras, but ourselves.",A 'FotoBalm' Event with Photographer Nancy Forde,9/25/2025,4:00:00 PM,6:00:00 PM,Atlantic Daylight Time,"Come discover how photography can be a practice toward healing. Because this is an in-person event and limited to 20 participants. Register early and reserve your spot: e-mail nancyfordephoto@gmail.com with the subject line: FotoBalm Event.

The word 'photograph' has Greek origins, meaning ""to draw light."" When life feels a bit in shadow, the practice of 'drawing light' is healing. This event will offer a chance to gather for community support and bring focus and observation to the grief process. Participants will wander Sir Sanford Fleming Park to 'draw light' into your camera and your spirit to discover how photography can be a practice toward healing. ","This in-person event is limited to 20 participants. For questions or to register early and reserve your spot: e-mail nancyfordephoto@gmail.com with the subject 'FotoBalm Event.' 

Registered participants will gather on Thursday September 25 (with Friday September 26 as a backup weather day.) We will meet at The Dingle gazebo in time for the 4:00 PM start. After a brief introduction, participants will wander the park to make photography. We will aim to return to the gazebo by 5:30 PM to share our experiences before departing at 6:00 PM. Participants might also like to bring a photograph meaningful to them on their journey towards processing grief.

Any type of camera is fine, even your smartphone. All skill levels (hobby, amateur, to professional photographers) are welcome. 

Participants are encouraged to wear walking or hiking footwear and dress appropriately for weather and exploring the park. Bring your own water bottles (and Kleenex, if needed.) Drawing light can also draw memory and emotion. ",This event is free. Donations are very welcome and appreciated.,,The event is limited to 20 participants because it is in person.
